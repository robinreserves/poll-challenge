# Robin Technical Challenge

Your challenge is to create a REST-ful API using node.js and express that acts
as a backend for a [Doodle Poll](https://doodle.com)-style app.

## Requirements

Your solution should include endpoints to:

* create a new poll (with choices)
* add choices to an existing poll
* close a poll (disallow further responses)
* respond to a poll
* view all responses on a poll

There is no need to build a frontend for this challenge, but you should make
it easy for someone to add a frontend later.

Additionally, you should include a database layer so that data will persist
between application re-deploys.

## Deliverables

* your app's source code, under version control
* a link to your app, deployed (psst... Heroku has a free option!)
* a short write-up to a frontend engineer on how they could interact with your backend
* a short write-up of any assumptions you made (if the requirements were unclear)
